## About

### Application Overview

- Productivity Timer wants to help you to be productive and stay in focus.
- It may also helps your eyes to relax if it is experiencing dryness due to too much glare on your screen without a break.
- It was design to help others reducing procastination that leads them to be unproductive.

### What is Pomodoro Technique

- Pomodoro Technique is a _time management method_ that will improve your focus and productivity. It encourages you to work within the time you have, rather than struggle against it.

- You will finish each day with a sense of accomplishment by doing nothing more than working in _25-minute blocks_ (called pomodoro sessions), followed by _5-minute breaks_.

- Pomodoro Technique is popular with freelancers wanting to track time, students wishing to study more effectively and anyone looking to improve themselves at work or in their personal projects.

### How does it work

:memo: 1. Choose task you'd like to get done.

:no_mobile_phones: 2. Focus and minimize distractions.

:alarm_clock: 3. Set the Pomodoro timer to 25 minutes, the standard pomodoro duration.

:computer: 4. Work on the task until the Pomodoro timer rings.

:coffee: 5. Take a short break of 5 minutes, breathe, meditate, grab a cup of coffee, go for a short walk or do something else relaxing (i.e., not work-related). Your brain will thank you later.

:repeat: 6. Repeat the cycle and every 4 pomodoros, take a longer break of 15 minutes or more.
